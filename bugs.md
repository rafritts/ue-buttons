# bugs.md — ue-buttons

Outright defects (wrong output, crash, corrupted state) found while building or driving
ue-buttons. Same discipline as `gaps.md`: a bug is **reproduced, fixed, and the fix
live-verified over the RC bridge**, and then **PRUNED from this file** — a completed bug is
deleted, not left behind with a FIXED banner. This file is the live worklist of what's
still broken; the reasoning behind a fix lives in git history and the code, not here. `B<n>`
numbers are never reused (grep git history for a retired one). Keep the repro and root cause
while a bug is open, not just "fixed".

Distinction from `gaps.md`: gaps are friction, missing capability, or design limits.
bugs are things that are *supposed to work and don't*.

Format: `### B<n> — <title>` · status · repro · root cause · fix · verification.
