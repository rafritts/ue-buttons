# gaps.md — ue-buttons

Every friction point the agent hits while driving UE becomes a numbered gap here.
Ported discipline from blender-buttons: a gap is **fixed and live-verified against the
running editor**, then **PRUNED from this file** — a completed gap is deleted, not left
behind with a FIXED banner. This file is the live worklist of what's still friction; the
reasoning behind a resolved gap lives in git history and the code, not here. "Verified"
means the fix was exercised over the RC bridge and the log/screenshot/`feel` confirms the
new behavior — not that it compiles. `G<n>` numbers are never reused (grep git history for
a retired one). Keep the reasoning while a gap is open, not just the diff.

Format: `### G<n> — <title>` · status line · what/why · resolution.

Gaps are *friction / missing-capability / design*. Outright defects go in `bugs.md`.

### G11 — the pack's "prebuilt cabins" are World assets, not spawnable Blueprints
Status: OPEN (palette knowledge for the user; E2/E6 adapt. Reviewed 2026-07-03: the five
World assets are SHOWCASE MAPS — Rural_Cabins + four *_Showcase — each a multi-item
display scene, so level-instancing one would drop a whole showcase into the level, not
"a cabin". No agent-side fix exists; the modular-composition route now has G10's
`place={"grid": ...}`. Remaining path is user asset curation.)

SPEC-01 expected "32 prebuilt cabin Blueprints" in Modular_Rural_Cabin. Reality (from
`asset packs`/`find`): the 32 Blueprints are modular *pieces* (Wall_*, Roof_*, Porch_*) plus
a few prop BPs (Mailbox, Outhouse, Trash_Bin); the 5 fully-built cabins ship as **World**
assets (level maps), which place via level-instancing, not `spawn_actor_from_class`. So E2's
"spawn one prebuilt cabin Blueprint" is satisfied by a prebuilt one-actor building BP
(Outhouse) — verified spawning as a single ground-snapped actor. For E6, a "prebuilt cabin"
means either level-instancing a cabin World (a new mechanism, not yet a verb) or composing
from modular pieces as E2 did. Flagged for the user (asset curation): if whole-cabin BPs are
wanted, they'd need to be authored from the World assets, or a `level-instance` placement
path added behind `add` (see SPEC-04 non-goals).

### G30 — no job/progress pattern for slow mutations: one pathological asset load can still outrun the HTTP timeout
Status: OPEN (successor to B6, 2026-07-02 — the two concrete offenders are fixed, the
general pattern isn't built. Reviewed 2026-07-03: deliberately deferred again — the
remaining wedge is a SINGLE atomic game-thread asset load, which even a tick-based job
can't chunk (the next dispatch would stall behind it on the game thread anyway); build
the async job + progress pattern when a new concrete offender appears to shape it,
not speculatively.)

B6's fixes hold: `path carve` batches its flatten features into ONE mesh rebuild (38-disc
carve round-trips in <0.5 s, was ~30 s dark), and `asset inventory measure=True` bounds each
batch by wall-clock (`seconds=`, default 20 s) as well as count. But the wall-clock check
runs BETWEEN mesh loads — a single cold Nanite mesh whose first load takes >60 s would still
wedge the bridge, and any future long game-thread verb inherits the same trap. The general
cure is an async job + progress pattern (kick the work off the dispatch path, poll a
`job_status`), or per-verb chunking as each new slow path appears. Until then: after any
timeout, poll `/remote/info` and RE-READ state before re-issuing — timed-out work usually
completed invisibly.
