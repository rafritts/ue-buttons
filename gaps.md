# gaps.md — ue-buttons

Every friction point the agent hits while driving UE becomes a numbered gap here.
Ported discipline from blender-buttons: a gap is **fixed and live-verified against the
running editor**, then **PRUNED from this file** — a completed gap is deleted, not left
behind with a FIXED banner. This file is the live worklist of what's still friction; the
reasoning behind a resolved gap lives in git history and the code, not here. "Verified"
means the fix was exercised over the RC bridge and the log/screenshot/`feel` confirms the
new behavior — not that it compiles. `G<n>` numbers are never reused (grep git history for
a retired one). Keep the reasoning while a gap is open, not just the diff.

Format: `### G<n> — <title>` · status line · what/why · resolution.

Gaps are *friction / missing-capability / design*. Outright defects go in `bugs.md`.

### G30 — no job/progress pattern for slow mutations: one pathological asset load can still outrun the HTTP timeout
Status: OPEN (successor to B6, 2026-07-02 — the two concrete offenders are fixed, the
general pattern isn't built. Reviewed 2026-07-03: deliberately deferred again — the
remaining wedge is a SINGLE atomic game-thread asset load, which even a tick-based job
can't chunk (the next dispatch would stall behind it on the game thread anyway); build
the async job + progress pattern when a new concrete offender appears to shape it,
not speculatively.)

B6's fixes hold: `terrain op=carve` batches its flatten features into ONE mesh rebuild (38-disc
carve round-trips in <0.5 s, was ~30 s dark), and `asset inventory measure=True` bounds each
batch by wall-clock (`seconds=`, default 20 s) as well as count. But the wall-clock check
runs BETWEEN mesh loads — a single cold Nanite mesh whose first load takes >60 s would still
wedge the bridge, and any future long game-thread verb inherits the same trap. The general
cure is an async job + progress pattern (kick the work off the dispatch path, poll a
`job_status`), or per-verb chunking as each new slow path appears. Until then: after any
timeout, poll `/remote/info` and RE-READ state before re-issuing — timed-out work usually
completed invisibly.

### G50 — no lighting surface: a cave interior is pitch black and the agent can't even say so
Status: OPEN (found 2026-07-04, L2 dogfood — predicted verbatim by the level brief)

The L2 cabin sits inside a sealed rock chamber lit only by what bounces through a 5 m
mouth. The verb surface has no way to author a light (the template sun/skylight are the
only sources, and they're outside), and no way to *perceive* darkness (perception is all
geometry — nothing reads luminance at a point). Two gaps in one: an authoring verb
(`add what=point_light` family or a `light` verb — SPEC-worthy, UE owns the word Light)
and a numeric light-level sense to make "it's too dark in here" a measurable finding
instead of a human complaint. PIE-tier check candidate for SPEC-09.
